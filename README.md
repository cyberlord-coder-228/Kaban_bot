Thats a simple telegram bot, developed by me when I was first year uni student.
My goal was to improve my programming skills, learn basics of Telegram API, and have fun with my groupmates.
All of the goals where successfully accomplished)

What this bot can do:
- locally evaluate some simple JS code (safely-ish)
- locally evaluate JS code without safety concerns (only for users with access)
- evaluate APL code, using Dyalog API
- mock my fellow gruopmates
- send random number
- send random card (as text)
- send five wiki articles about something
- transliterate from Ukrainian to English, and vice-versa
- transliterate from latin to morse, and vice-versa
- transliterate some text that was written using the wrong layout
- check whether user-send message was a hoiku
- send some funny gibberish
- tell a joke
